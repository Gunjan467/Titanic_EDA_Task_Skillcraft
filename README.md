## 📊 Visualizations

### 1. Survival by Gender
Shows how female passengers had a much higher survival rate compared to males. 
---

### 2. Survival by Passenger Class
First-class passengers had better chances of survival than third-class passengers.  

---

### 3. Age Distribution
Most passengers were young adults, with a clear distribution across different age groups.  
---

### 4. Correlation Heatmap
Correlation between numeric features such as Age, Fare, Pclass, and Survival.
